1) make an expense class where all the types before can inherit from it
2) keep track of how many transactions there are and make sure we process
    the same amount
2) write tests for the code
3) break up expenses even further to see spending habits (entertainment)
4) make ability to download csv on its own
5) automate it so that it does it weekly
6) make another script that will use generated files an make a monthly
  report

This would be everything that I would want and this would make it really
cool
After that there could be a couple things that you could do 

Stretch goals:
1) make a machine learning algorithm that will learn whats expenses
  should go where. It builds its dataset as a user chooses what goes
  where
2) make it user friendly with gui's
3) port it to an app
4) port it to a website
5) make it opensource on github
